# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to compare urban, suburban, and rural areas who utilize a ride-share company and make conclusions based off of statistical data. Looking at total rides, total drivers, total fares and the averages per ride and driver, we can see how and where ride-share is most prevalent and lucrative. 

## Results

### Total Rides
  - Urban cities had 1,625 total rides. 
  - Suburban cities had 625 total rides.
  - Rural towns had 125 total rides. <br />
As expected, there is a higher demand for ride-share services in urban areas compared to rural areas. 

### Total Drivers
  - Urban cities had 59,602 total drivers. 
  - Suburban cities had 8,570 total drivers. 
  - Rural towns had 537 total drivers. <br />
There are more drivers in urban areas compared to suburban or rural areas.

### Total Fares

  - Suburban cities had a total of $19,356.33 in fares.
  - Rural towns had a total of $4,327.93 in fares. <br />
More demand for rides in urban areas generate more in fares compared to suburban or rural areas.

### Average fare per Ride
  - Urban cities average fare per ride was $34.62.
  - Suburban cities average fare per ride was $30.97.
  - Rural towns average fare per ride was $24.53. <br />
Due to the higher demand for rides in Urban areas, the average fare per ride is higher in urban areas compared to suburban or rural areas.

### Average fare per Driver
  - Urban cities average fare per driver was $8.06.

## Summary
1. Looking at the first quarter you can see that fares in rural areas are relatively stable. However, there is a wave of high and low fares in urban areas in early spring. This could be attributed to different schools having different spring break weeks. Generally, people ride-share to airports for vacation and this could be the change we see in rides and fare during that time. Looking into spring break schedules could help determine surge pricing during this time. 
2. Looking at Suburban areas in the later end of the first quarter you can see that fares increase. This could be attributed to the same line of thinking as Urban areas during spring break, but for Suburban families going on summer vacation. 
3. For rural areas, fares seem to stay relatively stable. Look into big events like summer rodeos or festivals that generally happen in rural areas.
